SaaS Right is a small group of software engineers committed to building SaaS the right way. We focus on creating MVPs and boilerplate projects to accelerate SaaS development, leveraging our experience working with companies that serve millions of users. Most of our repositories are currently private, but weâ€™re working to make more of them public and accessible to everyone.
